# sveltestrap-app-template

Create bare bones [Sveltestrap](https://github.com/sveltestrap/sveltestrap) apps with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) included.

To use, simply execute command in shell:

    node create-app.js <name> <directory>

A new sub-directory with `name` is created under `directory`

The created application will be ready to run with:

    npm i
    npx vite

Note: Git is not initialized, you'll have to do it yourself, if needed.
